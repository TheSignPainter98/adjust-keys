Hello.
In this file you can specify the options you want to run adjustkeys with, such as the layout, glyph-map or colour-map you want to use.
You can get more information about each of the options by referring to the pdf documentation supplied with the release.

This file is written in YAML (which stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, a human-readible structured format for specifying data.
You can find pointers on the syntax at https://medium.com/@siliconlay/yaml-a-simple-introduction-414a2b174fb4
Most importantly here, *any line which starts with a # is a comment and is ignored*.
To edit an option, simply remove the # at the start of the line and change the value to the right of the colon.

The values shown here are the default values when the release was generated on a linux server.
The majority are the same as when you run this code, but in the case of `path`, a more Windows- or macOS-specific one are used in practice.
Exact default values can be seen by setting the `print_opts_yml` option to `true` and running the program as usual.

Options start below.
